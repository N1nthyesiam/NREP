This is NREP v0.1 reference

NREP - Network Republc Protocol
RecRoll - Ricochet Roll

This is secure data transfer protocol with zero trust policy for transmission nodes.

Handshake structure:
[header] (\xf2 - 1 byte constant value)
[version] (2 int compatible bytes - major and minor version)
[encryption] (1 byte raw data encription type \xff - disabled else enabled) #currently not used
[separator size] (1 int compatible byte - size of payload separator in bytes)
[separator] (a sequence of bytes of size [separator size])
[data/payload] (combination of [waypoints] and [keys] fields with same number of elements)
[waypoints] (list of encrypted by correspond [keys] value waypoints adresses separated by [separator])
[keys] (list of encrypted by rsa aes keys with nonces before them)

All subsequent data packets are transmitted directly with the specified encryption

Encryption is not supported in this version!

Network components:
[beacon] (provides information about nodes configurations)
[node] (base notwork component)

Encryption order:
The address of each waypoint in the format host:port is encrypted using a random aes key.
Each random aes key corresponding to a waypoint is encrypted using the rsa key of the previous waypoint.
Еhe address of the first point is not encrypted and is not added to [waypoints], as it is used only by the client.
The address of the destination (for example, a website) is encrypted according to the same principle as the address of the waypoint.

Example:
[first_wp_ip:port]  |  [second_wp_ip:port] [third_wp_ip:pors]  [destination_ip:port]
[not encrypted]     |  [first_random_aes]  [second_random_aes] [third_random_aes]
[not encrypted]     |  [first_pw_rsa_key]  [second_wp_rsa_key] [third_wp_rsa_key]

^^Not transmitted^^ |                   ^^^^Handshake Payload^^^^

Decryption order:
When decrypting (roll) a handshake, each node takes the first key from [keys] and decrypts it with its own rsa key.
The result is an AES key in the format (nonce+key), which decrypts the first element from [waypoints].
After that, the handshake is reassembled without the used elements from [waypoints] and [keys] and sent (ricochet) to the next waypoint (the one that was decrypted).

Each node stores the address from which it received the handshake [from] and the address where it sent it [to].
The node creates a new session whose task is to forward packets from [from] to [to] and vice versa.
In case of any error, the node must destroy the session.

At the first connection, the handshake is sequentially transmitted through the entire chain of nodes (ricochet roll),
after which they switch to repeater mode and simply transfer data packets.

Handshake process:
The client forms a handshake packet and sends it to the first node in the chain.
The handshake is sequentially transmitted through a chain of nodes,each node excludes information about itself from the handshake.
When the handshake reaches the last node of the chain, it sends the client one byte of data back along the chain and connects to the target host.
The handshake is complete.
